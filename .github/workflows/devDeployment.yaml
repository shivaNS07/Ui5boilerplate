To deploy an MTA (Multi-Target Application) to Cloud Foundry using a GitHub Actions workflow, you can use the cf deploy command instead of the cf push command. The cf deploy command allows you to deploy an MTA to Cloud Foundry by specifying the path to the MTA archive file (.mtar) and the name of the target space.

Here is an example of how you might do this:

Copy code
name: Deploy MTA to Cloud Foundry

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install Cloud Foundry CLI
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        echo "deb https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfoundry-cli.list
        wget -q -O - https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian/cli.cloudfoundry.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install cf-cli
    - name: Login to Cloud Foundry
      env:
        CF_API: ${{ secrets.CF_API }}
        CF_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.CF_USERNAME }}
        CF_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.CF_PASSWORD }}
      run: |
        cf api $CF_API
        cf login -u $CF_USERNAME -p $CF_PASSWORD
    - name: Build and push application to Cloud Foundry
      run: |
        cf deploy mta.mtar -s ${{ secrets.CF_SPACE }}
